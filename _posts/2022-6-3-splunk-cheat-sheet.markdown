### General

```bash
| eventcount summarize=false index=* | dedup index | fields index
```

List Source Types Metadata by index

```python
| metadata type=sourceypes index=*
```

List Source Types Metadata by index in time intervals

```shell
| metadata type=sourcetypes index=*
| eval firstTime=strftime(firstTime,"%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S") 
| eval lastTime=strftime(lastTime,"%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S") 
```

````python
`sysmon` | stats count by EventCode
````

```bash
| tstats <stats-function> from datamodel=<datamodel-name> where <where-conditions> by <field-list> 
```

```
`notable`
| stats count by rule_name
```

```python
`sysmon` Image=”*\\powershell.exe” OR Image=”*\\msbuild.exe” OR Image=”*\\psexec.exe” OR Image=”*\\at.exe” OR Image=”*\\schtasks.exe” OR Image=”*\\net.exe” OR Image=”*\\vssadmin.exe” OR Image=”*\\utilman.exe” OR Image=”*\\wmic.exe” OR Image=”*\\mshta.exe” OR Image=”*\\wscript.exe” OR Image=”*\\cscript.exe” OR Image=”*\\cmd.exe” OR Image=”*\\whoami.exe” OR Image=”*\\mmc.exe” OR Image=”*\\systeminfo.exe” OR Image=”*\\csvde.exe” OR Image=”*\\certutil.exe” | stats values(CommandLine) by Image

```
`sysmon` host=we8105desk | stats values(CommandLine) by Image _time
```

 ```
`sysmon` EventID=3 host=WE9041SRV | stats values(DestinationPort) by DestinationHostname
 ```

### Export Logs Local

```
sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk search "index=* AND sourcetype!=cisco* earliest=07/3/2021:23:59:00 latest=07/4/2021:23:59:00 " -output rawdata -maxout 0 > /tmp/logs_no_fw_1
```

### Time Diff (first and last event)

```python
| stats max(_time) as maxtime min(_time) as mintime 
| eval difference=maxtime-mintime
```

```bash
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com form_data="username=admin&*" sourcetype="stream:http" http_method=POST
| stats count by _time, status, form_data
| reverse
| head 2
| stats max(_time) as maxtime min(_time) as mintime 
| eval difference=maxtime-mintime
```

### Extract Text as field

```bash
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com form_data="username=admin&*" sourcetype="stream:http" http_method=POST
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<p>\w+)" 
| dedup p 
| stats count by _time, status, form_data,p
```

```
index=windows
| rex "(?m)Caller Process Name:\s*(?<Process>.*)"
| rex "(?m)Failure Code:\s*[^\s]+\s*(?<error>.*)"
| rex "(?m)Sub Status:\s*(?<error>.*)"
```

```bash
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com form_data="username=admin&*" sourcetype="stream:http" http_method=POST
| rex field=form_data "Signature string:(?<p>\w+)" 
| dedup p 
| stats count by _time, status, form_data,p
```

### Extract fields by split

```bash
index=av eventtype=symantec_ep_security
| eval fields=split(_raw,",") | eval signature=mvindex(fields,3)
| top limit=50 signature
```



# Maturity Assessment SPLs

### Sources types by index

```sh
| tstats values(sourcetype) as sourcetypes where index=* by index
| stats values(index) as indexes by sourcetypes
```

```sh
| metadata type=sourceypes index=*
```

### Accelerated data models and completion rate

```sh
| rest /services/admin/summarization by_tstats=t splunk_server=local count=0 
| eval datamodel=replace('summary.id',"DM_".'eai:acl.app'."_","") 
| join type=left datamodel 
    [| rest /services/data/models splunk_server=local count=0 
    | table title acceleration.cron_schedule eai:digest 
    | rename title as datamodel 
    | rename acceleration.cron_schedule AS cron] 
| table datamodel eai:acl.app summary.access_time summary.is_inprogress summary.size summary.latest_time summary.complete summary.buckets_size summary.buckets cron summary.last_error summary.time_range summary.id summary.mod_time eai:digest summary.earliest_time summary.last_sid summary.access_count 
| rename summary.id AS summary_id, summary.time_range AS retention, summary.earliest_time as earliest, summary.latest_time as latest, eai:digest as digest 
| rename summary.* AS *, eai:acl.* AS * 
| sort - complete
```

### Internal Log Errors

```sh
index=_internal latest=now() earliest=-7d@d source=*splunkd.log log_level!=INFO
| top limit=3 _raw by component
| sort -percent
```

### Amount of user searches by source types and index

```sh
index=_audit latest=now() earliest=-7d@d sourcetype=audittrail action=search search_id=* NOT (user=splunk-system-user ) 
| rex field=search "sourcetype\s*=\s*\"*(?<sourcetype_used>[^\s\"]+)" 
| rex field=search "index\s*=\s*\"*(?<index_used>[^\s\"]+)"
| stats count by sourcetype_used,index_used,user
| sort -count
```

### skipped searches

```sh
index=_internal latest=now() earliest=-7d@d sourcetype=scheduler status=skipped
| stats count earliest(_time) as earliest_run, latest(_time) as latest_run by savedsearch_name,status,reason
| eval earliest_run = strftime(earliest_run,"%F %T"), latest_run = strftime(latest_run,"%F %T")
| sort -count
```



# Detection Use Cases

### indexes not receiving logs

```sh

| stats count by host,New_Process_Name,Process_Command_Line,Creator_Process_Name
```

### logon from Multiple IPs

```sh
| tstats count values(Authentication.Source_Network_Address) as multiple_src dc(Authentication.Source_Network_Address) as src_count from datamodel="Authentication"."Authentication" WHERE  (Authentication.signature_id=4624 OR Authentication.signature_id=528) Authentication.Logon_Type=2 OR Authentication.Logon_Type=10 OR Authentication.Logon_Type=3 by  Authentication.user Authentication.signature  | rename "Authentication.*" as * | search src_count>1 count >2 | search multiple_src!=unknown multiple_src!="-"
```

```bash
| tstats count values(Authentication.Workstation_Name) as multiple_src dc(Authentication.Workstation_Name) as src_count from datamodel="Authentication"."Authentication" WHERE  (Authentication.signature_id=4624 OR Authentication.signature_id=528) Authentication.Logon_Type=2 OR Authentication.Logon_Type=10 OR Authentication.Logon_Type=3 by  Authentication.user Authentication.signature  | rename "Authentication.*" as * | search src_count>1 count >2 | search multiple_src!=unknown multiple_src!="-"
```

### Inactive Account Activity

```
| `inactive_account_usage("90","2")` | `ctime(lastTime)` | fields + user,tag,inactiveDays,lastTime
```

```python
| tstats summariesonly=t allow_old_summaries=t count min(_time) as earliest max(_time) as latest from datamodel=Authentication where nodename="Authentication.Successful_Authentication" earliest=-1d@d latest=@d by Authentication.user 
| rename Authentication.user as user
| multireport
[| stats values(*) as * by user
 | lookup account_status_tracker user OUTPUT count as prior_count earliest as prior_earliest latest as prior_latest
 | where prior_latest < relative_time(now(), "-90d")
 | eval explanation="The last login from this user was " . (round( (earliest-prior_latest) / 3600/24, 2) ) . " days ago."
 | convert ctime(earliest) ctime(latest) ctime(prior_earliest) ctime(prior_latest) ]
[| inputlookup append=t account_status_tracker
 | stats min(earliest) as earliest max(latest) as latest sum(count) as count by user
